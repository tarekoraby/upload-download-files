# Files Upload and Download in Java

This project enables users to upload and download files to and from the server.
The UI allows users to select local files to be uploaded to the server.
Once a file upload is completed, the UI offers a link allowing users to download
the file back from the server. 

The web app is developed entirely in Java using Vaadin Flow (no HTML or JavaScript involved).

## Running the application
The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line, 
type `mvnw spring-boot:run` (on Windows), or `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (on macOS or Linux).

Then, in your browser, open http://localhost:8080/upload-download.
